# Archetyping

Archetyping — it's just verb form of "**archetype**" noun, and, stargin from now — new way how to think, show and tell about types, without rocket science. Why this name used? In marketing and ad world with the help of archetypes, marketers could better, more obvious and faster, explain their meanings for wide range of consumers, using the same wording for different groups of people. This concepts looks like as good starting point for this reserch, whose main purpose is to find better symbol and sign systems or syntaxes on habitual use cases and programming languages. Later, i have plans to develop new ontology management software stack, combined with a suitable methodology for its applications in business, programmig, and analytical research.

## Syntax

### Hypotesis "One" (actual).

It is possible to create fresh-looking IDL (Interface Defenition) language with minimal learning curve, and based on TypeScript type representation, but нaving sufficient expressiveness for architectural design (in software development) at the level of detail as in the C4 standard. Initial stack & tools: golang for server-side, V8 as primary runtime (without nodejs), cue as schema description lang, and svelte with typescript / pure typescript on frontend. Additinal tools: Bun, Vite, SQLite, and several graph-based databases written on go and wrapped in DuckDB workflow.

#### Why?

Go types is too poor, typescript's too complex in details, but ugly in main features and not presented in runtime. Searching for one-source-of-thruth engeneering documentation language and shape, which will ensure the transfer of critical knowledge, hightlight accents in this knowledge for whole workgroup, and simplify the work of a software architect with complex systems and solutions.
